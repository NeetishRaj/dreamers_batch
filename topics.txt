######################

Mouse events: 
    https://javascript.info/mouse-events-basics

Event argument
    Example:  
        document.onclick = function(event) {
            // use event object here
        }

Three ways of working with Events in javascript
    1. Inline attribute
        <div onclick="click_handler()">

    2. object property
        Syntax:
            const someDiv = document.getElementById('someDiv');
            someDiv.onclick = function() {

            }
            
    3. addEventListener()
        Syntax: 
            const someDiv = document.getElementById('someDiv');
            someDiv.addEventListener('click', click_handler);

Important Notes

Q. Among the three ways to add events why would the addEventListenerbe preffered?

A.  The benefits of addEventListener are

    1. Can attach multiple event handler functions for same event.
    2. we can control capturing/Bubbling.
