Event Bubbling Vs Capture





Event Delegation

    It's a way to utilize Event bubbling and 
    prevent ourselves from attaching eventlisteners
    to all child items.

    We basically delegate the task of event handling to the parent.

    Example:  Parent and child can be any HTML element
        <parent>
            <child></child>
            <child></child>
            <child></child>
        </parent>

        parent.onclick = function(event) {
            // use event.target property to access the child items
        }
