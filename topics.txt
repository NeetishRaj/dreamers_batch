React Part 9: Function Vs Class components
##########################################

Class Components
    - We create components using class syntax


Lifecycle methods
    - Reference: https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html
    - These are the methods covering the life stages of a component.
    - We use them to do certain operations inside component

        for example-
            constructor
                - global variables initialization
            componentDidMount
                - used for fetching some data
            componentWillUnmount
                - cleanup before component is destroyed

    - Class syntax                      - function syntax
    - this.state is used to             - useState() hook is used
        maintain state
    - We have to do binding of          - No binding is required in most cases
        methods
    - We use Lifecycle methods          - Use use Hooks like useEffect()
        like componentDidMount,
        componentDidUpdate, etc

Q. How are the functional components used in newer versions of React?

A. 
    Before Hooks
        - Class components were used as stateful components
        - Function components were used as functional components
    
    After Hooks
        - Class components discouraged
        - Function components are used as both stateful/functional components using Hooks.
