Q. How to add routing to my existing react project?

A. These are the steps

    1. Install "react-router-dom" package.
        npm install react-router-dom

    2. Wrap the complete <App> component with BrowserRouter component
        import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

        <BrowserRouter>
            <App />
        </BrowserRouter>

    3. Specify all the routes and connect them with their corresponding components

        <Routes>
            <Route path="/">
                <Route index element={<HomePage />} />

                <Route path="about" element={<AboutUsPage />} />

                <Route path="*" element={<PageNotFound />}/>
            </Route>
        </Routes> 

    4. [Optional]: Specify the outlet where the routed components will be rendered

        <Outlet />

    5. Now we can use the <Link> to create links to our React routes

        import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

        <nav>
            <Link to="/"><div>Home</div></Link>
            <Link to="/about"><div>About Us</div></Link>
            <Link to="/contact"><div>Contact Us</div></Link>
        </nav>
