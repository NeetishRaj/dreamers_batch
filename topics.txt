React 2: Components Concept

"EVERYTHING IS A COMPONENT IN REACT"


nodejs 
    - get OS info using internal 'os' module

npm(node package manager)
    - create a new empty npm project
        > npm init -y

    - install dad jokes npm package
        > npm install --save @mikemcbride/dad-jokes

    node_modules folder is where all the ecxternal library code gets dumped in.

    package.json is very important file which tracks all the info related to the npm

npx
    Is very similar to npm and can be used to install packages but
    it also helps to run package specfic commands which npm cannot do.



create-react-app (Documentation: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)

    create our first react app
    > npx create-react-app my-app

    go inside the project
    > cd my-app

    Run the development server
    > npm run start

    Now we can go to localhost:3000 to see the React app and see the changes live
