N candies

G groups of candies (all groups will have <= 3 candies)


Round 1: 
N = 8
G = 3
a b c,    p,q, r     x, y

crushing: a, p and x
CrusH cost : 3 x G = 9$


Round 2: 
N = 5
G = 2
b,c,q,   r,y

crushing: b and r
CrusH cost : 2 x G = 4$


Round 3: 
N = 3
G = 1
c,q,y

crushing: c
CrusH cost : 1 x G = 1$


Round 4: 
N = 2
G = 1
q,y

crushing: q
CrusH cost : 1 x G = 1$

Round 5: 
N = 1
G = 1
y

crushing: y
CrusH cost : 1 x G = 1$


Total cost: 9 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16$
